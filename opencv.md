## Convenience
`imutils` is a helper library for OpenCV, that simplifies the use of certain OpenCV functions: 
- The `PiVideoStream` class enables streaming from the Pi camera with multithreading, thereby improving FPS and overall performance.
- The `resize` function of `imutils` ensures that the aspect ratio of the original image is always maintained when resizing.

Do check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jrosebr1/imutils) for more of the useful features. Maybe even check out his blog which has a ton of tutorials on OpenCV, ranging from simple image processing to motion detection to deep learning.
