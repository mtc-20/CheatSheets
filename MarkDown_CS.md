# MarkDown Cheat Sheet
**In  random order**


# Contents
1. [Section Links](#section-links)
2. [Check Boxes](#check-boxes)




## Section Links
You can create links to sections/headers within the document itself by enclosing the link text in [ ] followed by the name of the header to be linked in all lowercase
prefixed with a # and enclosed in ( ).
For example, typing this
```
[link text](#header)
```
should give you this

[link text](#header)


## Check Boxes
Use [ ] and [x] in your indented list to denote open and closed checkboxes, like so
- [ ] Remind self to look into improving readability of MarkDown files
- [x] Create a repo that consolidates commonly forgotten features




### Header
Just to test the section link
